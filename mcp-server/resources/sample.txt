This is a sample resource file for the MCP server tutorial.

The MCP server can access files in the resources directory through the FileReaderTool.
This demonstrates how the server can provide access to data and documents while keeping
the actual agent logic on the client side.

Key facts about MCP architecture:
- Server provides tools and resources
- Client contains agents and business logic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable and maintainable design

Example usage:
- Agents can request to read this file
- Server provides the content via the file_reader tool
- Agent processes the content according to its logic
